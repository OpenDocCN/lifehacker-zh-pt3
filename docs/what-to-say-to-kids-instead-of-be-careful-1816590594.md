# 对孩子说什么而不是“小心”

我经常告诉我四岁的女儿“小心”，以至于我把它缩写成了“caref”这已经成为一种本能。她正要从浴缸里爬出来。]“Caref。”*她在泳池栏杆附近游泳。*]“Caref。”她的膝盖离她小表妹的脸很近。】“Caref。”她在一家服装店里面蹦蹦跳跳。]“Caref！”

虽然我愿意认为我的警告会让她思考自己目前的行动，但事实可能并非如此。“‘小心！’加拿大自然联盟&[的孩子](http://childnature.ca/when-you-want-to-say-be-careful/) 的 Petra Eperjesi 写道当我们一遍又一遍地听到一些东西时，我们都开始走神，不是吗？"

这些话甚至可能是有害的。卡洛琳·保罗曾在 TED 演讲《抚养勇敢的女孩 》中做了精彩的演讲，她写道“小心！”落在[的阴险恐惧之语](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/opinion/sunday/why-do-we-teach-girls-that-its-cute-to-be-scared.html?_r=0)下根据《儿科心理学杂志》的一项研究，父母在受伤后“告诉女孩要比男孩更小心的可能性是男孩的四倍”，正如保罗指出的，这可能会阻止他们在未来尝试舒适区之外的挑战性体育活动。

孩子们确实需要指导，但是提醒应该适用于手边的情况。我女儿的幼儿园老师很聪明，在操场上照看过很多孩子，他经常告诉孩子们“记住”。记住，石头很重。记住，当你滑下滑梯时，有朋友在你下面。记住棍子可能很锋利。我非常喜欢这样。

当谈到在大自然中玩耍时，Eperjesi 给了 [一个“小心”替代](http://childnature.ca/when-you-want-to-say-be-careful/) 的列表。以下是一些可以在各种情况下使用的方法:

> *   "Focus on what you are doing."
> *   "What's your next move?"
> *   "Do you feel safe there?"
> *   "Take your time."
> *   "Does that branch feel strong and firm?"
> *   "If you need me, I'm right here."
> *   "When you run, please find a safe place for your cane."
> *   "Pay attention to others and give them enough space." Let's move to this area with low traffic flow.
> *   "Sticks need space. Sarah, look around you-do you have enough room to swing that big stick? "
> *   "Please put one end of the cane on the ground!"
> *   "What's your plan with that big stick?"
> *   "Rocks need space!"
> *   "Find more space!"
> *   "What do you need to look for before you throw that stone?"
> *   "That stone looks really heavy! Can you manage it well? "
> *   "Please move slowly and carefully around _ _ _ _."
> *   "Please give each other a lot of space, so that no one feels that they need to push, and no one will be accidentally knocked down."
> *   "Do you feel stable/balanced?"
> *   "Do you need more space?"
> *   "Before you tackle others, make eye contact. Be sure to let them know that you are coming, so that they can get their bodies ready. "
> *   Check each other. Make sure everyone has a good time. "
> *   "Ask her how she is."
> *   "Ask him if he's still having fun."
> *   "Do you like it? If you don't like this, be sure to tell her. "
> *   "If you need to run, meet me at the next trail mark!"
