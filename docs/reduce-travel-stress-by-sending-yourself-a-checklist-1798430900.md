旅行应该是有趣和令人兴奋的，但是那种你正在忘记一些事情的恼人感觉会给你的准备工作增加不必要的压力。如果你想从开始打包行李到拎着行李箱出门的这段时间里消除这种感觉，你需要这份清单。

切尔西·法甘 [在《金融饮食》](http://thefinancialdiet.com/email-sent-make-solo-international-travel-feel-easy/) 中解释了她整理的清单，并用电子邮件发给自己，以确保她没有忘记任何东西。这份清单是为去法国拜访她的姻亲而准备的:

> *   [Attach the aforementioned spreadsheet](http://thefinancialdiet.com/how-i-transform-my-chaotic-wardrobe-into-a-super-organized-travel-spreadsheet/) , and check it before I leave to make sure my bag has everything I need. From friends' snack requests to gifts for parents, a to-do list.
>     
> *   Arrival time and terminal of my plane, with electronic boarding pass.
>     
> *   A precise plan for taking a bus from the airport to the city, followed by a taxi (this includes a timetable with bus routes attached). The entrance direction of my first owner's apartment (screenshot of the outside of her building, her password, where to find her key, etc. ).
>     
> *   Her phone number in France.
>     
> *   A preset alarm clock went off at 4 o'clock in the morning when I had to go south by train.
>     
> *   Attached is my e-ticket for the train, round trip.
>     
> *   My in-laws phone number has been added to WhatsApp. My third master's entrance instructions, like the first one, he wasn't there when I arrived-codes, instructions for finding keys, etc.
>     
> *   The customer service number of my American credit card in case it is blocked or lost due to fraud.
>     
> *   The information on my French debit card, which I borrowed from Marc in case I need to withdraw cash without paying the fee. A series of good places to work, with reliable Wi-Fi, where I can always find a quiet seat.

你的列表可能会有一点不同——例如，如果你真的在度假，你不需要一个地方列表来完成工作。如果你不能方便地访问数据或无线网络，电子邮件也可能不是保存列表的最佳方式。Evernote，你手机或平板电脑上的原生笔记应用，或者(打印出火车票之类的东西)都是让你的旅行清单触手可及的可靠方法。
