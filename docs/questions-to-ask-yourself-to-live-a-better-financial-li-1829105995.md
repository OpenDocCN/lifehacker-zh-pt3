虽然有无数种方法可以让你的财务井然有序，但这一切都始于了解什么对你和你的家庭来说是重要的:你的优先事项是什么，你的价值观是什么？一旦你确定了这一点，你需要采取的步骤就会变得更加清晰。

为了更好地理解什么对你来说是重要的，以下是乔纳森·克莱门茨提供的 31 个问题，他是华尔街日报的前个人理财专栏作家，现任《谦逊的美元》的编辑，关于“从你的消费中获取最大的快乐”和追求重要的目标:

> 如果金钱不成问题，你会改变你的生活吗？
> *   What is your biggest financial concern? What are the three smartest financial moves you've ever made?
>     *   What do you think are your three biggest financial mistakes?
>     *   How much financial help should be given to children? When is the happiest time in your life, what makes you feel happy-what role does money play, if any? How much money do you need at least every month to maintain your financial life?
>     *   If you lose your job, how long can you keep spending before you have to take drastic financial measures? What have you learned from your parents about money-which of these beliefs do you take as your own? Think of three people you know who are in very good financial condition. What is the key to their financial success? Is it important for you to drive a good car? If so, why? What are your favorite and least favorite moments in a typical week?
>     *   Is getting rich one of your overriding goals in life?
>     *   Think about your weaknesses. Are they acceptable human weaknesses-or do they cause significant losses, including significant economic losses? Who depends on you financially-how will they cope if you die prematurely?
>     *   When can I get into debt? Think about the major expenses in your life, such as buying a house, a car, renovation projects, expensive holidays and paying for college. Which ones are most likely to make you smile and which ones disappoint you? What's on your list of major expenditures in the next few years? Do you think the house is a good investment? Why? What is your net worth-the value of everything you own minus all debts? Does your stock and bond portfolio reflect your income or lack of income?
>     *   Imagine your perfect retirement day. How will you spend it-will you be happy doing these things every day for the rest of your life? Do you have any children-whether your own or someone else's-who you want to help financially? What kind of help do you want to provide?
>     *   In late 2008 and early 2009, did you buy stocks, sell them or wait and see?
>     *   How much investment cost do you invest each year? If you hadn't been dragged down by the knowledge you hold, sell and market performance, would you have your current portfolio? If you hold bonds and other interest-bearing investments, minus all debts, what is your net bond position? Are you expected to pay off all your debts when you retire?
>     *   If you die tomorrow, will you leave a mess? When was the last time you talked honestly with others about your financial situation? If you were writing your own obituary, what would you write? What other achievements do you want to add in the next few years?
>     T93

我从《一美元不起眼的简讯》 中引出了这个问题，但 Clements 说他在他的新书《从这里到财务幸福》[](https://humbledollar.com/book/from-here-to-financial-happiness/)**中详细讨论了这些问题。**

*其中一些并不适用于所有人，但几乎所有这些都是很好的思想实验:你认为买房对你和你的家人来说是一项好的投资吗？在你的一生中，你到底想要完成什么？金钱在这个中扮演了怎样的角色？依赖你的人是谁，你认为你欠他们多少？*

*花点时间，无论是你自己还是你的配偶或你生活中的其他决策者，来回答上面的几个问题，如果不是全部的话。它们不仅会让你变得清晰，还会帮助你找到通往财务自由的道路，不管这对你意味着什么。*
